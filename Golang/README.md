This is a homework for functional programming course.

**Features done**:

- Parser: all required features (I think)
- Compile-time scopes
- Type checking
- Termination checking (checks that every function that returns a value terminates)
- Types: integer, string, boolean, arrays, functional types
- Conditionals
- Functions:
  - Functions as values
  - Local functions
  - Recursion
- ...

**Features in progress (and TODOs)**:

- `main` function signature validation
- Runtime scopes (currently the scope is flat)
- Array element assignment
- Closures
- Goroutines and channels
- ...
